# **Learning Objectives**
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

~General~
- What is the ML Life Cycle?
- What are the challenges of implementing the ML Life Cycle?
- How to use Databricks and MLFlow to deploy an ML Model

# **Tasks**
**Project Requirements:**

- Create a student Databricks account and sign up for their community version. Then, develop your own ML project using Databricks and MLFlow:

- Pick any of the models that we have built over the course of this specialization and implement it in Databricks
- Create a new MLFlow experiment
- Create a new cluster
- Add your data
- When your ML model is ran, it should keep track of the relevant parameters and metrics
- Your model should be packaged into an MLflow Model
- When done, please include screen shots of the results of your training and logging with Databricks below.
